# linked-list

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Create a Linked List class, which has properties of a head, and a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Created a Node class with a value and next properties.
- Created a LinkedList class with a head property.
- Created an insert method that adds a new node with a value to the head of the list.
- Created a toString method that returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
